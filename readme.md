# Purpose of this repo
I created some scripts that might be handy in my electrical related works
## 1.posible_combo_with3resistors
2025/12/04

>The idea, or the question is that what is the minimal amount of resistors I need in the field to get *whatever* values i need. 
After some digging, there are comments online that points out E3 series (ex: from 10 to 100 it would be 10, 22, 47) resistors are already good enough.
So I vibecoded this piece of script quickly as proof of concept. I set the maximum of resistors with 3 since it is hard to hand twisting too much in a series or parellel without bad connections, although more can be added easily.

## 2.skin_effect

>Analyzing the effect of skin effect for coil windings, with the graph generated with the code. We can safely say that below 1Mhz it is not such a huge deal for thin wires.
