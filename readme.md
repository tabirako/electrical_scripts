# Purpose of this repo
I created some scripts that might be handy in my electrical related work

>The idea, or the question is that what is the minimal amount of resistors I need in the field to get *whatever* values i need. 
After some digging, there are comments pointed out that E3 series (ex: from 10 to 100 it would be 10, 22, 47) resistors are already good enough.
So I vibecoded this piece of script quickly as proof of concept. I set the maximum of resistors with 3 since it is hard to hand twisting too much in a series or parellel without bad connections, although more can be added easily.
